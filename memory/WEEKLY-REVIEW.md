**Sector Context (week ending 2026-05-22)**
- Nifty Metal: +1.91% ✅ — portfolio Metals positions aligned (JSWSTEEL +1.66%, HINDALCO +1.68%)
- Nifty Private Bank: +1.40% ✅ — Finance (MANAPPURAM +3.18%) benefited from broader NBFC tailwind
- Nifty IT: -5.71% ❌ — drag on TECHM (-2.61%); sector underperformed despite Nvidia Q1 FY27 beat
- Nifty FMCG: -1.13% ❌ — drag on RADICO (-2.07%) and TATACONSUM (-0.39%)
- Nifty Telecom: hit 52-week high this week — yet BHARTIARTL underperformed at -1.55% vs entry

**What Worked**
1. **Gate 8 prevented binary risk** — 6 stocks blocked (TORNTPHARM, NYKAA, GRASIM, APOLLOHOSP, DIVISLAB, CIPLA, ONGC all had earnings within 7 days). At least 3 of these reported volatile results. Gate 8 is working exactly as designed.
2. **Metals thesis was correct** — Nifty Metal +1.91% weekly. Both JSWSTEEL (HARD: earnings beat, Q4 revenue +14% YoY) and HINDALCO (HARD: Q4 FY26 strong standalone ops) delivered gains aligned with the sector. HARD catalyst + sector momentum = reliable combination.
3. **Low-score high-catalyst outperformed high-score low-catalyst** — BAJAJ-AUTO (score 40/100, ₹30k min-size) delivered +3.96%, beating every 80-score entry. The ₹5,633 Cr buyback was a concrete near-term price driver that quantitative momentum scores couldn't fully capture. Catalyst quality > GRU score for short-term performance.

**What Didn't Work**
1. **IT position despite sector headwind** — TECHM entered with HARD catalyst (Q4 PAT +21% QoQ) but Nifty IT fell 5.71% this week. The sector-wide selloff overrode the company-level earnings beat. TECHM now at -2.61% with only 4.51% buffer to stop. Risk: stop triggers Monday if IT weakness continues.
2. **FMCG sector concentration with crude headwind** — RADICO and TATACONSUM both entered when Brent crude was $110/bbl. FMCG sector -1.13% weekly; elevated crude (margins) and DXY at 6-week high (import costs) were consistent headwinds visible pre-entry. Gate should be more sensitive to crude levels for FMCG stocks.
3. **BHARTIARTL underperformed its sector** — Nifty Telecom hit a 52-week high this week, yet BHARTIARTL is -1.55% from entry. Company-specific weakness vs sector strength. Score had already declined 80→40 by May 22 research scan, suggesting momentum faded quickly post-entry.

**Strategy Changes This Week**
- No rule changes this week — 0 closed trades (need ≥ 20 for data-driven rule changes per performance_analyzer.py protocol)
- Observing: FMCG entries during elevated crude (>₹100/bbl Brent) may warrant additional Gate consideration — flag for review after 20+ closed trades
- Observing: Sector-level momentum score decline (BHARTIARTL 80→40 within 48h of entry) suggests exit trigger may be needed before stop loss — monitor

**Next Week**
- **Critical watches**: TECHM (stop ₹1,360.03, buffer 4.51%) and RADICO (stop ₹3,361.95, buffer 5.03%) — both at risk if sectoral weakness continues Monday
- **Upcoming earnings**: ONGC results May 26 (not held — just monitor); DIVISLAB May 23 (not held)
- **Sector to watch**: IT — Nifty IT -5.71% this week; if sector stabilizes, TECHM thesis may recover; if weakness extends, stop will trigger
- **Cash reserve**: ₹48,500 — can deploy one ₹30,000 score-40 position if a stop triggers and creates room for a score-60/80 re-entry
- **Target approach**: BAJAJ-AUTO at +3.96%, MANAPPURAM at +3.18% — both may approach +15% partial-exit trigger in coming weeks; prepare partial exit logic
- **Gemini API**: rate limiting (20 req/day free tier) and 503 errors constrained catalyst verification all week — consider upgrading tier or batching research queries to avoid quota exhaustion by midday
- **BHARTIARTL**: monitor for recovery — if Nifty Telecom sector strength continues and BHARTIARTL remains flat, consider exit before stop to redeploy capital into stronger names
